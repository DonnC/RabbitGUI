- Created using python and PySimpleGUI, refer to official docs or [site](http://www.PySimpleGUI.com)
- short quick doc [here](screenshots/doc.pdf)
- After a run, go full screen to see the full window

## Motive
- Home rabbit rearing project, need to log rabbit data to a permanent storage rather than books manually
- The keeper can keep track of who borrowed his rabbit (usually for mating purposes)
- Also keep track of the rabbits that he borrowed too
- Also add notes and other useful information

### Making a standalone application

```bash
$ pyinstaller rabbit_gui.py
```

### Run
